# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
When i was in my 6th class i asked my father about his dream job then he mentioned about software field also he said that he used to work 
with oracle programs but due to some family problems he changed his career and started his own business then i decided to become a 
software engineer with out knowing about it. Later i asked my brothers who are working in different software companies. From then i 
was interested in editing and coding stuff.I used to editing for time pass at beginning. During lockdown my uncle suggested me to 
take online coding classes and i started to take classes in udemy. However it didnt worked out after lockdown i went to offline 
classes and learned some programing languages like c,java.. So i dont want to stop here and i think amfoss will guide me to the path 
where i can learn more about my passion.I personally feel that seeing this passion of mine amfoss can think of choosing me for the club.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
When i started to complete the tasks.Tasks are found a bit difficult to me but later on when i started to uderstand and learn the tasks.
I really Enjoyed and found myself a bit interested to completing the tasks.So I want to go ahead in this field as much as i can in the next
6 months and i am sure that if i got selected for amfoss i can progress at a appreciable rate.I also want to give some focus on 
academics because my parents want a good result from me.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I really dont know in what way i can contribute something to the club but if i have an opportunity to contribute back to the club 
i will grab the opportunity and i will give my best..
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process was awesome.. For me it was totally new experience.. At the beginning i dont have any idea about this but later when i
started to complete the task i learnt new things. Whether i may select to the amfoss club or not but this process and experience i had while 
completeing these was awesome.. Also my seniors they are very friendly they helped me a lot.. Thanks to My Senior Brothers and Thanks to Amfoss-Club.
